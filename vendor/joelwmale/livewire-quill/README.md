---

This package adds an easy to use Livewire component to your application, which will create and largely manage a [Quill]([Quill](https://quilljs.com/)) editor for you.

It instantly supports the image uploads with zero work from you.

> v2.0 of this package only supports Livewire v3.x. If you're still using Livewire 2.x, please use [v1.0](https://github.com/joelwmale/livewire-quill/tree/v1.0.0) of this package.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require joelwmale/livewire-quill
```

### Config (optional)

After you've installed the package, you can optionally publish the config to change any defaults:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire-quill:config
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    /*
     * The base folder to store the images in
     */
    'storage_folder' => env('LIVEWIRE_QUILL_STORAGE_FOLDER', 'images'),

    /*
     * Should the images be stored publically or not
     */
    'store_publically' => env('LIVEWIRE_QUILL_STORE_PUBLICALLY', true),

    /*
     * Should the images be deleted from the server once deleted in the editor
     * or retained for future use (note: the package will never re-use the same image)
     */
    'clean_up_deleted_images' => env('LIVEWIRE_QUILL_CLEAN_UP_DELETED_IMAGES', true),
];
```

## Usage

Use it in any Livewire component like so:

```php
@livewire('livewire-quill', [
    'quillId' => 'customQuillId',
    'data' => $content,
    'classes' => 'bg-white',
    'toolbar' => [
        [
            [
                'header' => [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, false],
            ],
        ],
        ['bold', 'italic', 'underline'],
        [
            [
                'list' => 'ordered',
            ],
            [
                'list' => 'bullet',
            ],
        ],
        ['link'],
        ['image'],
    ],
])
```

On your Livewire component, add the following:

```php
use Joelwmale\LivewireQuill\Traits\HasQuillEditor;

class SomeLivewireComponent extends Component
{
    use HasQuillEditor;

    public function contentChanged($editorId, $content)
    {
        // $editorId is the id use when you initiated the livewire component
        // $content is the raw text editor content

        // save to the local variable...
        $this->content = $content;
    }
}

```

### Parameters

#### QuillId

A div is created with this id, this allows for easy use of multiple quill instances on the same page.

#### Data

This is the initial value of the text editor (i.e: a previous saved version of the text editor)

#### Classes

Any custom classes you wish to add to the base editor class.

Note: for any customisation, we recommend using CSS to make changes. You can always edit a specific Quill instance by referring to the #quillId variable.
