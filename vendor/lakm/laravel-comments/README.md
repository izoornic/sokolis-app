## Why Commenter

The commenting feature is a common requirement for most websites. Allowing users to comment enables interaction and enhances the user experience. While Laravel offers a wealth of packages to meet various project needs, there are limited options when it comes to commenting features. 

### Here are some drawbacks of existing commenting packages:

- Outdated: Uses outdated technologies and is not actively maintained.
- Lack of Features: Missing many essential features.
- No Admin Panel: Requires additional time to implement an admin panel independently.
- Bad Design: Interfaces are not user-friendly.
- Not Mobile Responsive: Not optimized for mobile devices.
- Performance Issues: May cause performance slowdowns.
- Lack of Configurability: Limited options for customization and configuration.

Due to these issues, most companies tend to opt for commercial packages or plugins. However, spending extra money on commercial packages reduces the company's overall profit. This package is developed to address all these shortcomings.

> As a full-stack developer, I have personally encountered these issues. That's why I developed this package‚Äînot only for my own projects but also to benefit other developers.

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
composer require lakm/laravel-comments -W
php artisan commenter:install
```

### Usage
Implement `CommentableContract` and import `Commentable` trait in commentable model.

```php
use LakM\Comments\Concerns\Commentable;
use LakM\Comments\Contracts\CommentableContract;

class Post extends Model implements CommentableContract
{
    use Commentable;
}

```

Implement `CommenterContract` and import `Commenter` trait in commenter model.

```php
use LakM\Comments\Concerns\Commenter;
use LakM\Comments\Contracts\CommenterContract;

class User extends Model implements CommenterContract
{
    use Commenter;
}
```

Include styles in your layout.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        @commentsStyles
    </head>
</html>
```

Include scripts in your layout.

```html
<html>
    <body>
        @commentsScripts
    </body>
</html>
```

Include the comments component with the related model.

```html
    <x-comments::index :model="$post" />
```

> [!Warning]
> You can omit the index part but make sure to include the double colon. Otherwise Laravel will search for the component in project instead of package.

```html
    <x-comments:: :model="$post" />
```
